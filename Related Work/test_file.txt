hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in today's video I'm going to show you everything you need to know to get started working with reactjs so why don't you go ahead and sit back relax and enjoy the show react is a JavaScript library not framework that's used to easily build and arrange user interfaces for web applications react focuses on building a web application using these things called components a component is a self-contained section of code that functions as as a reusable building block think of Legos you could say a Lego is similar to react component each Lego represents a section of reusable JavaScript and HTML code we can build a diarama or other complicated structure from these Legos if we use enough of them and in the correct places react uses a syntax extension of JavaScript known as jsx meaning JavaScript XML jsx allows you to write HTML like code within your JavaScript files react also utilizes a virtual Dom it's a lightweight version of the real Dom of a web page we can keep track of any changes made to the virtual Dom and only apply that specific change to the real Dom without needing to refresh the entire web page only that specific section this reduces rendering performance overhead before we do begin you will need to know JavaScript since react is a JavaScript library everything up to arrays classes objects and es6 feature such as Arrow functions will be necessary HTML will also be mandatory since our react components involve rendering HTML elements and applying CSS
